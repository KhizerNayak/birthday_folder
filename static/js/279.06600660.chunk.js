I called her precious, my heart's delight, Her beauty shining, ever so bright."}),(0,h.jsx)("h2",{children:"She loves sports, and kisses the sunshine, A cute look on her face, so divine.

With a cute puff look, and a love for selfies, A rose in her hand, making sweet memories."}),(0,h.jsx)("h2",{children:"Pearly eyes covered by glasses so neat, A face mask on, still looking sweet. I love when she tells me to eat my food, When she rolls her eyes, changing my mood. I love to tease her, and watch her study, Maybe I make mistakes, but I want to make it up, buddy. I want to touch her soul, beyond the physical, Daily I crave her, my patience feels minimal. This is our story, from sweet 18 till now, A romantic, sad tale, of love profound. In her, I find my heart's true song, In her presence, I feel I belong."})]})},17:()=>{}}]);
