      <h1 >A silent Crush </h1>
      <h2>
      In the realm of hearts, a secret dwells,
A tale of longing, where affection swells.
Within the halls of my dear school,
A crush blossoms, defying the rule.

      </h2>
      <h2>
      I have a crush on my college miss, you see,
Her presence captivating, like a gentle sea.
In classrooms, her words enchant and inspire,
Fanning the flames of my hidden desire.
      </h2>
      <h2>
      Oh, her guidance, a beacon of grace,
Navigating paths, leaving an indelible trace.
Her smile, a sunbeam, warming my day,
Her laughter, a melody, chasing worries away.
      </h2>
      <h2>
      Her wisdom, a treasure, shines so bright,
I yearn to bask in its radiant light.
Her nurturing ways, like a comforting embrace,
Make my heart flutter, as it keeps its pace.
      </h2>
      <h2>
      But alas, a boundary stands in our way,
Student and teacher, destined to obey.
For she is my guide, my mentor, my confidant,
And I, a student longing for her enchant.

      </h2>
      <h2>
      Yet in my heart, this crush I'll keep,
A cherished secret, buried so deep.
For a school miss imparts knowledge's art,
Guiding young minds with a caring heart.
      </h2>
      <h2>
      So, I'll treasure this crush within my soul,
Allowing it to shape and make me whole.
For the lessons learned in this silent desire,
Will fuel my dreams and set my heart afire.
      </h2>
      <h2>
      To my school miss, a beacon of light,
Thank you for guiding me, like stars in the night.
This crush, an emblem of admiration's might,
Shall forever guide me, as I take flight.
