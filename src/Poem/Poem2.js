      <h1>A changing Heart</h1>
      <h2>
      "In a world where chaos reigns supreme,
Amidst the crowd, a timeless dream.
I open the door, and there she stands,
Her anklet from the sandal, like grains of sand,
A delicate adornment, in craftsmanship grand."
      </h2>
      <h2>
      Behind her back, I quietly tread,
To guide her through the streets we'll thread.
In shops of cloth, her smile so bright,
I'm lost in her, amidst the light.

      </h2>
      <h2>
      Her praise I offer, a tender art,
For in her presence, I find my heart.
I'd shield you from any harm or strife,
For you are the treasure of my life .

      </h2>
      <h2>
      But in my haste, a bag I've missed,
Her presence leaves my mind dismissed.
For her, I'd brave the wildest storm,
Lost in her gaze, I'm truly sworn.

A selenophile, she loves the moon,
Her beauty shines, like a sweet tune.
I notice every detail, every glance,
Enraptured by her graceful dance.
      </h2>
      <h2>
      A milkshake drink, her choice I'll buy,
For her, I'd reach the highest sky.
Though today's date may be just shopping,
In her presence, my heart is hopping.

And as we part, hand in hand,
I'll cherish every moment, every strand.
For in her eyes, I see the art,
Of love's embrace, in every part. 
      </h2>
      <h2>
      As she leaves, my heart aches,
 I yearn for more,
To hold this moment, to explore.
But time slips away, like grains of sand,
I'll cherish this memory, hand in hand.

Next time, I vow, I'll make it right,
Hold her close, in love's sweet light.
But for now, as you fade from view,
Know  I stay  always stay true.
Wait for me, I plead you , in this sweet moment for you.

      </h2>
      <h2>
      But she's gone, like a fleeting dream,
Leaving behind a silent stream.
I wanted to dedicate this poem, so pure,
To her, my dove forevermore.  

In the silence that follows, I recall,
Every moment, every rise and fall.
And though she's gone, her essence lingers,
In the air, in my heart's singers.

Until we meet again, beneath the moon's glow,
I'll hold this memory, and let it grow.
For in her absence, I'll find the key,
To unlock love's door, and set it free.
