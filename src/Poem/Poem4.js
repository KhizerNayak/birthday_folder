      <h1>On her Birthday</h1>
      <h2>
      I fell in love with a girl in her twenties,
A love so deep, it feels like plenty.
With photos of her from when she was eighteen,
A princess in pink, a sight so serene.

On her birthday, she dressed like a queen,
A pink gown and crown, a royal scene.
I called her precious, my heart's delight,
Her beauty shining, ever so bright.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        
She loves sports, and kisses the sunshine,
A cute look on her face, so divine.
Hand on her chin, she covers her style,
Changing traditions, making life worthwhile.

She loves her headphones, even in pain,
Filling her hands with henna, again and again.
With a cute puff look, and a love for selfies,
A rose in her hand, making sweet memories.
      </h2>
      <h2>
      Pearly eyes covered by glasses so neat,
A face mask on, still looking sweet.
I love when she tells me to eat my food,
When she rolls her eyes, changing my mood.

I love to tease her, and watch her study,
Maybe I make mistakes, but I want to make it up, buddy.
I want to touch her soul, beyond the physical,
Daily I crave her, my patience feels minimal.

This is our story, from sweet 18 till now,
A romantic, sad tale, of love profound.
In her, I find my heart's true song,
In her presence, I feel I belong.
