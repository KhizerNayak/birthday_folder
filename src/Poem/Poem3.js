      <h1>In every Frame i love You </h1>
      <h2>
      In the hues of the setting sun's soft glow,
A love story unfolds, a rhythm slow.
Where hearts entwine, and love does grow,
In whispers gentle, feelings overflow.

Adorned with specs, in zebra's white attire,
Beneath twilight's canvas, hearts aspire.
In denim's embrace, a snug jacket attire,
She paints dreams afresh, with passion's fire.

      </h2>
      <h2>
      In red's embrace, a skirt so bold,
Graceful and elegant, stories untold.
As the sun bids adieu, its journey told,
Her radiance remains, memories enfold.

In the second frame, a moment divine,
A cake's sweetness, love's sign.
A ring on her finger, a bond so fine,
In a world of two, love's stars align.
      </h2>
      <h2>
      Amidst laughter and joy, hearts combine,
In a dress of green, family entwined.
With checks in place, love does shine,
In bonds of affection, ever so fine.

And in the final frame, a scene so dear,
Her smile radiant, holding memories near.
Eating rice with love's cheer,
Her eyes sparkle, love's frontier.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        
Through each image, a tale is spun,
Of love's journey, under the sun.
With her as the muse, hearts undone,
In every frame, love's saga begun.
      </h2>
